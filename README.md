## Spacecreftmotion
This script simulates the motion of a spacecraft in orbit using the physics equations governing orbital mechanics. It uses the 2D position vector of the spacecraft, the gravitational parameter of the Earth (mu) and the velocity vector of the spacecraft to simulate the motion of the spacecraft in an elliptical orbit. It also uses a loop to update the position and velocity of the spacecraft at each time step and stores the results in arrays for plotting.
## Requirements
-Python 3.6 or later
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Additional libraries and modules, depending on the features that you decide to include.
## Usage
Download or clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/dafrabzinator/Orbital-Simulation.git`
Install the required libraries and modules.
Run the script using Python: python3 -m spacecraftmotion.py
## Notes
Keep in mind that, as you add more complexity to the simulation, the computation time will increase, so you may want to consider using a more powerful computer or parallelizing the simulation.
